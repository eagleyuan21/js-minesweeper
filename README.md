# js-minesweeper

This is a quick minesweeper game I made from scratch with html and javascript. This can be played at https://www.eagleyuan.com/projects/minesweeper.

A few features include being able to select the dimensions of the square board and how many mines are on the board. The program will automatically default so that the number of mines won't be greater than the total cells in the board. Another feature is the timer, which starts on the first click. Upon losing, the timer will turn red. Upon winning, the timer will turn green.
